of efficiency of walking trajectories generated online. Extensions
of a previously introduced Linear Model Predictive Control law
are proposed that allow to improve the walking performance
through variation of the height of the CoM and toe flexion.
Extensive simulations serve to demonstrate the capacity of
the improved scheme to generate significantly more efficient

robot and the ground. We address this problem, using an original, continuous approach. We first demonstrate how this intrinsically discrete problem can be made continuous, and then present two applications: an experiment of vision-based reactive footstep planning with the DLR-Biped robot, and a simulation of non-gaited locomotion planning with a hexapod robot.}

 abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate an equivalence between a large class of discrete
motion planning problems, and piano mover’s problems, which we refer to as
"continuous motion planning problems". We first prove that under some assumptions,
discrete motion planning in d dimensions can be transformed into continuous
motion planning in 2d+1 dimensions. Then we prove a more specific, similar
equivalence for which the number of dimensions of the configuration space does
not necessarily have to be increased. We study two simple cases where this theorem
applies, and show that it can lead to original and efficient motion planning algorithms,
which could probably be applied to a wide range of multi-contact planning
problems. We apply this equivalence to a simulation of legged locomotion planning
for a hexapod robot.}

method for footstep planning for humanoid robots. Similar
to the classic bounding box method (which uses a single
rectangular box to encompass the robot) it is computationally
efficient, easy to implement and can be combined with any
rigid body motion planning library. However, unlike the classic
bounding box method, our method takes into account the
stepping over capabilities of the robot, and generates precise leg
trajectories to avoid obstacles on the ground. We demonstrate
that this method is well suited for footstep planning in cluttered
environments.}

one in the discrete case (Chapter 5), and one in the continuous case (Chapter 6). We
validate these methods in simulation and with several experiments on the robot HRP-2.}
